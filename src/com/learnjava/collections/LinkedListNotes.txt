LinkedList :
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. The underlying data structure is Double Linked List.
2. Insertion order is preserved.
3. Duplicate objects are allowed.
4. Heterogeneous objects are allowed.
5. Null insertion is possible.
6. LinkedList implements Serializable, Cloneable Interfaces but not RandomAccess Interfaces.
7. LinkedList is best choice if our frequent operation is Insertion/ Deletion in the middle.
8. LinkedList is worst choice if our frequent operation is retrieval in the middle.

Constructors:

LinkedList ll = new LinkedList();

Creates an empty LinkedList object.

LinkedList ll = new LinkedList(Collection c);

Creates an equivalent LinkedList object for the given Collection.

LinkedList class specific methods:
Usually we can use LinkedList to develop Stacks and Queues. To provide support for this requirement LinkedList class defines, the following specific methods:

		void addFirst (Object o);
		void addLast (Object o);
		Object getFirst ();
		Object getLast ();
		Object removeFirst ();
		Object removeLast ();
		
		
Differences between ArrayList and LinkedList
