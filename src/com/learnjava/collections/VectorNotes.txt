Vector:
============================

1. Underlying data structure is Resizeable Array/ Growable Array.
2. Insertion order is preserved.
3. Duplicates are allowed.
4. Heterogeneous objects are allowed.
5. Null insertion is possible.
6. It implements Serializable/ Cloneable/ RandomAccess Interfaces.
7. Every method present in Vector is synchronized and hence Vector object is Thread-safe.

Constructors:
============================

	1. Vector v = new Vector();
	
	Creates an empty Vector object with default initial capacity 10. Once Vector reaches its maximum capacity, a new Vector object will be created with below formula:
	
					New capacity = Current capacity * 2;
	
	2. Vector v = new Vector(int initial_capacity);
	
	Creates an empty vector object with specified initial capacity.
	
	3. Vector v = new Vector(int initial_capacity, int incremental_capacity);
	
	Creates an empty vector object with specified initial capacity and increments everytime it reaches its maximum by specified incremental capacity.
	
	4. Vector v = new Vector(Collection c);
	
	Creates an equivalent Vector object for given Collection object. This constructor is meant for inter conversion between Collection objects
	
	
Vector Specific methods :
==================================

	To add objects:
	======================
		add(Object o) ==> Collection method
		add(int index, Object o) ==> List interface method
		addElement(Object o) ==> Vector method.
		
    To remove objects:
    ======================
    	remove(Object o) ==> Collection
    	removeElement(Object o) ==> Vector
    	remove(int index) ==> List
    	removeElementAt(int index) ==> Vector
    	clear() ==> Collection
    	removeAllElements() ==> Vector
    	
    To get objects:
    ======================
    	Object get(int index) ==> List
    	Object elementAt(int index) ==> Vector
    	Object firstElement() ==> Vector
    	Object lastElement() ==> Vector
    	
Other methods:
==================================
	
	int size(); ==> Total number of elements
	int capacity(); ==> Total number of elements Vector can hold.
	Enumeration elements();
